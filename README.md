A very light weight web app utility to grab the localStorage available under a specific webpage url. 

> Used `Puppeteer` to render the page on server side in a headless chrome browser to grab the localStorage items.

> `[⚠️ Outdated Currently ]` Also a common space to render minimal UI pages of specific personal/handy needs. Currently has - [Wordle of the day](https://localstorage.onrender.com/wordle) grabber.
